# 1.Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Functionality of the Program:
This program checks whether a given number is even or odd.

🔍 Step-by-step:
Asks the user to enter a number.

Tries to convert the input to an integer.

If the conversion is successful:

It checks if the number is even (divisible by 2).

If yes, it prints: X is an even number.

If not, it prints: X is an odd number.

If the user enters invalid input (like letters or symbols), the program catches the error and shows a message:
👉 "Please enter a valid integer."


#2
The program loops from 1 to 50, keeps adding each number to a running total, and then prints the result. It's a great example of how loops and variables work together!

Let me know if you’d like to try this with user input instead of a fixed range!
